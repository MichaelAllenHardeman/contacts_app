Create a database in postgres called contacts_app, then run the following commands:

    sudo su postgres
    psql -U postgres -d contacts_app -a -f forward_engineer.sql

`contacts_app.xml` was created in [dbdesigner fork](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dbdesigner-fork/). Unfortunately this is windows only, but I couldn't find a quality, free, database design program for postgres.
